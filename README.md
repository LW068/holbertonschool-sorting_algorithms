# 0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description:

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that takes a collection of elements and rearranges them in a certain order. This can be ascending order, descending order, or any other predefined order. The goal of a sorting algorithm is to put the elements in a sequence that has some meaningful property. For example, the elements might be put in ascending order of their values, or they might be put in alphabetical order. There are many different sorting algorithms, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, and quicksort.
